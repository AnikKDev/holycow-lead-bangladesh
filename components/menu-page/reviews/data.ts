			'Excellent authentic Indian food. We have tried a few other restaurants in the Kentish and Archway area and this is by far the best and itâ€™s a takeaway! The food is freshly cooked and always delicious. Only once have they delivered late (just 20 minutes) and they rang me first to point out the problem and gave me a free dish. We probably use them twice a month and would highly recommend. Yum!',
